# WeatherPaint

- Made for the [OLC CodeJam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2022)

*WeatherPaint* is a simple browser toy where you can paint on a grassy canvas using rain, snow, and hail. You can use
the sun tool to melt and dry the "paint", or wait until it vanishes by itself.

This was made for the [OLC CodeJam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2022). It's very similar to *Music Factory*, my
entry to the 2020 jam, but it was made in one day rather than a week (and is probably much less interesting to play).
